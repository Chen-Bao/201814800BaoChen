This repository contains Chen Bao's homework and projects of Data Mining Class on the first year of her master in Shandong University. The advisor name is Jianhua Yin. 

====================

<Experiment 1>

***see the file "20news-knn"***

run following programs in order:

main_tfidf # generate the tf value and idf value. This method invokes process.py

main_matrix # construct vector space model. This method invokes constMatrix.py

main_unitVector # normalize the vectors

main_knn # classification using knn

main_accuracy # compute the accuracy of classification

flag=0 # processing training data

flag=1 # processing testing data

====================

<Experiment 2>

***seee the file "NBM"***

run following programs in order:

main_process # generate pre-processed document. This method invokes process.py

main_probability # calculate the conditional probability of each word in each category

main # calculate the prior probability of each category

main_test # input test data and calculate Naive Bayes Model

====================

<Experiment 3>

***seee the file "SkLearn"***

run following programs in order:

pre.py # pre-process document

main.py # calculate tf-idf

sktest.py # all kinds of clustering method
