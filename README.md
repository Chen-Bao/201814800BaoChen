Experiment 1

see the file "20news-knn"

run following programs in order:

main_tfidf # generate the tf value and idf value. This method invokes process.py

main_matrix # construct vector space model. This method invokes constMatrix.py

main_unitVector # normalize the vectors

main_knn # classification using knn

main_accuracy # compute the accuracy of classification

flag=0 # processing training data

flag=1 # processing testing data
